# Angular Shopping List

This is a functional shopping list built in Angular, allowing users to add items, edit existing items, and delete items. Items can be added via the enter key or by hitting the Add button, edits can be made and confirmed through the edit and confirmed buttons respectively, and the delete button deletes an individual item. Each item can also be clicked to indicate it has been bought, or unclicked in case a shopper realizes they picked up the wrong item, and still need to pick up the correct one. 

## Getting Started

To run the Shopping List application, download the folder, unzip it, and open your terminal. If you have npm installed, change your terminal's directory to the list folder. From there, start npm and the list should open in your browser. If you do not have npm installed, the Angular website has setup instructions here: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/setup.html.
